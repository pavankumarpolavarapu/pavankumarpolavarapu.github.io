Hello friends, My name is Pavan Kumar Polavarapu, I am a passionate developer interested in Machine Learning and researching more on the topic. I have a Technology blog Technophileshub but I felt it would better to keep track using git for all the learning outcomes of the projects that I am working on.

## Background
I am currently pursuing my Master's in Information Systems from Lindner College of Business - University of Cincinnati. Pursuing Master's from a business college implies covering breadth of several topics through course work and finding topic of your interest and exploring the depth on your own. 

About my previous education background, I received my under graduate degree in Information Technology from VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology and worked for Deloitte Consulting about 7+ years on SAP Development.
