## About 
Hey, Thanks for stopping by, My name is Pavan Kumar Polavarapu, I am a passionate developer interested in Machine Learning and researching more on the topic. I have couple of Tech blogs in the form of Technophileshub and SAP for Beginners but I felt they are more or less How to guides for beginners and I would like to use Git to save my learning outcomes or experiences. Please feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavankumarpolavarapu/){:target="_blank"} or on my email <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> if you need any help or you found any mistakes that I should correct.

## Background
I am currently working as Software Development Engineer - 3 at Walmart based out of Bentonville, Arkansas. Prior to that I did my Master's in Information Systems from Lindner College of Business - University of Cincinnati. It was quite an experience. Pursuing Master's from a business college implies covering breadth of several topics through course work and finding topic of your interest and exploring the depth on your own. Before that I worked for Deloitte about 7 years which included may be 4 promotions but the final title was Senior Consultant. I did my bachelors in Information Technology from VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology before joining Deloitte. Here is my [Resume](https://technophileshub.com/resume/view.php?download_file=Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}
